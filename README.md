# Cloud_Automation
AWS Cloud Automation Scripts and DevOps learning will be saved here.

My plan is to first begin with cloud formation because thats the easiest way and then learn to interact with AWS using Python modules . When things go fine i will be adding some Terraform codes .

_ Cloudformation
- Python
- Terraform
